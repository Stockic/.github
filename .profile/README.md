Stockic is a minimal and intelligent finance newsfeed application for Android and IOS without noise like ads and promotions. We gather news from various trusted sources, compile their insights with AI, and feed it to you so you don't have to wander around different platforms. This enhances your productivity and keeps you updated with current finance news. All the content would be untouched, and everything would move through AI to prevent any external human interpretation of news so that you can get exact insights in short forms.     

We are planning premium plans that provide no noise of ads and promotions, sensible notifications, and a weekly email with all the week's news, again generated by AI. Here at Stockic, we believe that AI can be used in the content field without losing the human touch of information. Without the app, you would have an intelligent news feeder in your pocket, relieving you from jumping through different apps and losing your productive hours.
